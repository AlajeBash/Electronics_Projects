# Ultrasonic Sensor with Buzzer

This Arduino program utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance of an object. When an object is detected within a certain range (e.g., 20cm), a buzzer connected to the Arduino will sound.

## Components Required
- Arduino board
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Buzzer
- Jumper wires
- And a Bread Board

## Circuit Diagram
Connect the components as follows:

## Connection
### Arduino
